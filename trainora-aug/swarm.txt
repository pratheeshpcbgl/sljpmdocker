# Setup cluster: one manager and 1 worker  (docker node: vm1 and vm2)
# Test: hitting any of the swarm node will work since request will be routed to the container where container is working

#Firewall port 
TCP port 2376 for secure Docker client communication. This port is required for Docker Machine to work. Docker Machine is used to orchestrate Docker hosts.
TCP port 2377. This port is used for communication between the nodes of a Docker Swarm or cluster. It only needs to be opened on manager nodes.
TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes (container network discovery).
UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic (container ingress networking).
